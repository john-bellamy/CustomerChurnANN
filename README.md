# CustomerChurnANN
An example of customer churn classification using an ANN.

# Abstract

The data from kaggle contains 10,000 samples of a German bank's customers, some of which have closed their account. An artificial Neural Network was built to predict if a csutomer will leave. The final model's accuracy is around 85%. The model could be used to apply to current customers to "tag" customers that might be at risk to leave, to target with a campaign to prevent churn.
